The Evidence Algorithm programme was initiated in the early 1960s
by Academician Viktor Glushkov at the Institute of Cybernetics of
Kiev, Ukraine (USSR at the epoch). Serious advances have been made
by the research group of EA, including the formal text language TL,
an original deductive engine, and a working implementation of SAD.
Later the project was abandoned (over non-scientific factors) and
restored only in 1998. Today, the SAD system is developed by three
people:

    Dr Alexander Lyaletski <lav@unicyb.kiev.ua>
        Faculty of Cybernetics,
        Kyiv National Taras Shevchenko University,
        Kiev, Ukraine

    Prof. Konstantin Verchinine <verko@capet.iut-fbleau.fr>
        Departement Informatique, IUT Senart/Fontainebleau,
        University Paris XII "Val de Marne",
        Fontainebleau, France

    Andrei Paskevich <andrei@capet.iut-fbleau.fr>
        University Paris XII "Val de Marne", France

Authors thank everybody who took part in the development of SAD
over the forty years of the project's existence. We are especially
thankful to Viktor Glushkov, Fyodor Anufriev, Viktor Bodnarchuk,
Anatoli Degtyarev, and Marina Morokhovets.
