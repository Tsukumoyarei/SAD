Subdirectories:
===============

Alice/  is the core program of SAD. It processes a given input text
        using a built-in "foreground" reasoner (collection of proof
        search heuristics) and an external "background" first-order
        prover. Alice is written in Haskell, a general purpose,
        purely functional programming language (http://haskell.org).
        See doc/design.txt for further details.

    Core/           - verification procedure and reasoner
    Data/           - definition of principal datastructures
    Parser/         - syntax analyser and basic primitives
    Export/         - interface to external provers
    ForTheL/        - grammar of ForTheL
    Import/         - reader routine and first-order syntax


moses/  is the prover for first-order logic with equality used as
        the background prover in SAD by default. Moses is based on
        an original goal-driven sequent calculus and is written in C.
