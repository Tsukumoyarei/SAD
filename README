The System for Automated Deduction (SAD) is intended for automated 
verification of formal texts written in a special language called 
ForTheL (which stands for FORmal THEory Language) or in first-order 
language. SAD is developed in the frame of the "Evidence Algorithm" 
project (http://nevidal.org.ua).

The SAD system is freely distributed under the conditions of 
the GNU General Public License. It can be downloaded or used
online at the web site of the project.
